# P7 - Potency Based Search Heuristic
The Report outlining the Potency Based Search Heuristic is a valiable as `Report.psf`

## Reproducability
All data used to compile all plots and tables can be found under the folder `Latex Files`.
In here there are three csv files:
 - `data_nonreduced.csv`
   - Contains all execution results from redeuced models and queries 
 - `data_reduced.csv`
   - Contains all execution results from non-redeuced models and queries
 - `TruthLookup.csv`
   - Contains the correct solution to most instances 
   - Was gained by running the original Tapaal search strategies on all models and queries 

All plots and tabels can be compiled by running the `Latex Files/compile_plots_tabels.sh` script.
